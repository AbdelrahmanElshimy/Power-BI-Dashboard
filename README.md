## üìà Additional Recommendations

- **Ensure stocking levels for high-performing products** (like those with high *Max Order Quantity*) are optimized to prevent stockouts and maximize revenue from the most popular items.  
- **Conduct a detailed investigation into the 2014 data** using the Year filter. Analyze whether the stagnation is due to decreased customer acquisition, lower average order value, product line issues, or increased competition in specific territories.  
- **Replicate the North American sales strategy and processes** (e.g., marketing campaigns, sales incentives) for the smaller European and Pacific regions to drive up their performance.
